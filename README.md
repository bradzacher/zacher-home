The landing page of my personal website.

Uses static code generation, and React SSR to generate a static, self-contained HTML page.

## But you're a web-based engineer, why build a static page?

Good question! Because there is currently no need to have a dynamic one.
There is nothing fancy that I currently want to achieve on my personal landing page.

Also by building server-side react, I've set it up such that I can consider hydrating react on the client should I need that in the future.
